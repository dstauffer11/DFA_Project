# DFA_Project
This project can be used to build DFAs, NFAs, and regular expression. Once defined, functions exist to minimize DFAs, convert NFAs to DFAs, convert regular expressions to DFAs and NFAs (and the reverse), and check equality of two DFAs. The makefile.sh can be executed (".makefile.sh") to compile the project. Findlib and Ounit are both required to compile the project. A Makefile also exists which is not currently updated but can easily have a few lines added to make it fully functional. There is also a folder containing an attempt at a parser to read regular expressions from a text file. It compiles but has not been tested. 

The unit testing file contains a number of tests of correctness for the project. Some of the testing uses functions which are not very robust and depend on list order.
